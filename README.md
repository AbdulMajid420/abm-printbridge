# 🖨️ ABM PrintBridge

**Universal Printing Platform for Windows — One Engine, Every Printer, Zero Drivers.**

> Offline-first · Enterprise-reliable · One line to integrate.

---

## Overview

**ABM PrintBridge** transforms Windows printing from a fragile, driver-dependent process into a **reliable, unified platform**. A single lightweight engine manages all printers, handles job queues, and provides complete visibility into printing operations.

Any application — POS, ERP, healthcare, retail, or web — connects with **one line of code** and gains enterprise-grade printing reliability.

### Quick Start Examples

**Print a File**
```csharp
// Connect and print — that's it.
await using var client = await PrintBridgeClient.ConnectAsync();
await client.PrintFileAsync("kitchen-printer", @"C:\order.pdf");
```

**Embed Dashboard**
```csharp
// Embed complete printer management dashboard in any WinForms app.
Controls.Add(new FleetViewWeb { Dock = DockStyle.Fill });
```

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional Windows printing suffers from critical limitations:

- **Driver Fragility** — Printer drivers crash, conflict, and require constant maintenance
- **Silent Failures** — Print jobs vanish without explanation or recovery mechanism
- **Scattered Logic** — Every application reinvents printing with inconsistent results
- **Zero Visibility** — When printing fails, there's no way to diagnose what happened
- **Vendor Lock-In** — Tied to specific printer models and their driver ecosystem

**PrintBridge eliminates all of these** by providing a single, battle-tested printing layer that any application can rely on.

PrintBridge provides a central printing service that decouples applications from printer management, ensuring reliability and scalability across your organization.

## Platform Components

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Print Engine** | .NET 8 (Windows) | Core printing service with queue management, recovery, and REST API |
| **Client SDK** | .NET Standard 2.0+ / .NET 8 | Lightweight library for any .NET application |
| **Dashboard** | .NET 8 (Windows) | Embedded printer management and monitoring UI |
| **REST API** | HTTP/JSON | Platform-agnostic integration for web and cross-platform apps |

> **Legacy-Friendly:** The engine uses modern .NET 8, but the SDK supports .NET Framework 4.6.1+ — so decades-old POS and ERP systems can integrate without platform upgrades.

---

## Supported Printing Scenarios

| Format | Use Case | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Thermal Receipts** | POS, retail, hospitality | Purchase receipts, order tickets, queue tokens |
| **A4 Documents** | Invoicing, reporting | Tax invoices, statements, purchase orders |
| **Labels** | Logistics, healthcare | Shipping labels, prescription labels, barcode stickers |
| **Kitchen Orders** | Restaurant KDS/KOT | Order tickets with automatic routing to kitchen stations |
| **Batch Processing** | ERP, accounting | Month-end invoice runs, bulk statement printing |

---

## Industry Applications

| Industry | Value Proposition |
|---|---|
| **Retail & POS** | Serve all checkout terminals with one engine. Receipts, invoices, returns — never lose a print during peak hours. |
| **Restaurants** | Kitchen tickets (thermal) + customer bills (A4) from one order. Automatic retry if kitchen printer is busy. |
| **Healthcare** | Prescription labels, patient wristbands, lab reports — with complete audit trail for compliance. |
| **ERP & Accounting** | Batch invoice printing from legacy .NET Framework 4.x systems via the SDK — no system upgrades needed. |
| **Logistics** | Shipping labels, packing slips, delivery manifests — monitor hundreds of printers from one dashboard. |
| **Web Applications** | Server-side printing via REST API. Embed the dashboard in any web portal. |
| **ISV / Platform** | Ship printing as a built-in feature. Drop in one control for full printer management. |

## Getting Started

### Installation

**Install the Print Engine**
```powershell
# Download and run MSI installer (or portable executable)
# Engine runs as a Windows service
```

**Add SDK to Your Project**
```powershell
dotnet add package ABM.PrintBridge.Client
```

### Basic Usage

```csharp
using ABM.PrintBridge.Client;

// Auto-connect to local engine (zero configuration)
await using var client = await PrintBridgeClient.ConnectAsync();

// Discover available printers
var printers = await client.ListPrintersAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"Found {printers.Count} printers");

// Print a document
await client.PrintFileAsync("main-office", @"C:\invoice.pdf");

// Print a formatted thermal receipt
await client.PrintReceiptAsync("counter-1", receipt => receipt
    .Center()
    .Bold(true)
    .Line("ABM TECHNOLOGIES")
    .Bold(false)
    .Line("Tax Invoice")
    .Separator()
    .Line($"Date: {DateTime.Now:dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm}")
    .Line($"Total: PKR 1,500.00")
    .Feed(2)
    .Cut()
);
```

### Dashboard Integration

**WinForms**
```csharp
// Embed complete printer management UI
var dashboard = new FleetViewWeb { Dock = DockStyle.Fill };
this.Controls.Add(dashboard);
```

**WPF**
```csharp
// Embed via WindowsFormsHost
var host = new WindowsFormsHost();
host.Child = new FleetViewWeb { Dock = DockStyle.Fill };
grid.Children.Add(host);
```
